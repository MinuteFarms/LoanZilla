# 🐉 Loanzilla - Advanced Student Loan Monster Battle Game

**Transform your student loan debt into an epic battle against a growing monster!** Loanzilla is a gamified mobile app where users attack a monster (LoanZilla) that grows based on real student loan interest. Users engage with the monster through free and paid in-game actions, with proceeds from in-app purchases going toward repaying real student loans.

## 🎮 Core Concept

Loanzilla visualizes your student loans as a monster that grows daily based on real interest accrual. Each loan is mapped to specific parts of the monster or represented as floating orbs. Higher-interest loans are more aggressive visually, and users can target specific loans for strategic gameplay.

## ⚔️ Game Mechanics

### Monster System
- **LoanZilla** visually grows daily based on real interest accrual from your actual student loans
- Each loan corresponds to a unique HP value based on its current balance (default: 1 HP = $0.01)
- Higher-interest loans are more aggressive visually and offer better XP rewards when targeted
- Interactive loan orbs with tooltips showing loan details, balance, interest rate, and daily interest cost

### Damage & Loan Mapping
- **HP Mapping**: Each loan corresponds to a unique HP value based on its current balance
- **Targeting System**: Users can target specific loans; selecting high-interest loans offers visual and XP incentives
- **Real Impact**: Damage dealt translates to real loan reduction potential
